This GitHub Action generates a description of a pull request using Generative AI.

- [example](https://github.com/pelikhan/action-genai-pull-request-descriptor/pull/4#issue-3147857342)

> [!NOTE]
> This action uses [GitHub Models](https://github.com/models) for LLM inference.

## Inputs

- `instructions`: Custom prompting instructions to generate the message.
- `gitmojis`: Whether to use [Gitmojis](https://gitmoji.dev/) in the message. Defaults to `true`.
- `excluded`: A comma-separated list of file paths to exclude from the message.
- `github_token`: GitHub token with `models: read` permission at least (https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/reference/github-actions/#github-models-permissions). (required)
- `debug`: Enable debug logging (https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/reference/scripts/logging/).

## Usage

Add the following to your step in your workflow file:

```yaml
uses: pelikhan/action-genai-pull-request-descriptor@main
with:
  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The action requires the `models: read` permission to access GitHub Models inference and
`pull-requests: write` permission to update the description of the pull request.

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  models: read
```

## Example

Save this code as `.github/workflows/genai-pull-request-descriptor.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: GenAI Pull Request Descriptor
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, ready_for_review]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  models: read
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
  generate-pull-request-description:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pelikhan/action-genai-pull-request-descriptor@main
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Development

This action was automatically generated by GenAIScript from the script metadata.
We recommend updating the script metadata instead of editing the action files directly.

- the action inputs are inferred from the script parameters
- the action outputs are inferred from the script output schema
- the action description is the script title
- the readme description is the script description
- the action branding is the script branding

To **regenerate** the action files (`action.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`), run:

```bash
npm run configure
```

To lint script files, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To typecheck the scripts, run:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

To build the Docker image locally, run:

```bash
npm run docker:build
```

To run the action locally in Docker (build it first), use:

```bash
npm run docker:start
```

To run the action using [act](https://nektosact.com/), first install the act CLI:

```bash
npm run act:install
```

Then, you can run the action with:

```bash
npm run act
```

## Upgrade

The GenAIScript version is pinned in the `package.json` file. To upgrade it, run:

```bash
npm run upgrade
```

## Release

To release a new version of this action, run the release script on a clean working directory.

```bash
npm run release
```
